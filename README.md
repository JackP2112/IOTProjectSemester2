## Automatic Guitar Tuner

This system allows for a user to tune a stringed instrument, such as a guitar.  
The microphone detects the pitch of a plucked string and the motor then turns  
the machine head in order to change the pitch to whatever the user selected.


### Motivation

Tuning any stringed instrument is something that must be done regularly.  
The process is monotonous, methodical and while not difficult for the  
player, it is time-consuming and repetitive, something which is ideal  
for a simple system like this.


### Installation
